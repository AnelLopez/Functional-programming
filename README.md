## First-class functions

In JavaScript, functions are first-class, which means they can be assigned to variables, passed as arguments to other functions, and returned as values from other functions.

#### Code example

```JS
const sum = (a, b) => a + b;

const result = sum(2, 3); // Using the function like any other value
console.log(result); // Output: 5
```
